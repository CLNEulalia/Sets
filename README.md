# Sets

Sets are a simple, nifty little data structure. They're similar to arrays with one key difference: They only hold unique values.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Define a set and how itâ€™s used in programming. 
- Distinguish between a set, an array, and a linked list. 
- Implement a set and common methods used in sets.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Linked Lists

## Activity 

There are two components to this lesson:
1. myGA module: [Sets](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/465)
2. In-Class Exercise: [Implementing a Set](set.js)

**To do the in class exercises, you can either...**

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files
1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/gEOeZW) provided by the myGA Hash Tables Deep Dive module
1. Regardless of which way you choose, the exercises are the same (but the codepen has testing)
